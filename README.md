# PURE-deeplearning-plasma-sheaths

This was some of the work I conducted as part of PURE (Promoting Undergraduate Research in Engineering) on applying neural networks to model plasma physics. I was advised by Moutaz Elias. 

Our goal was to model the energy-angle distribution of ions impacting a surface in contact with the plasma with deep learning and neural networks. Due to the physics of plasma sheaths, a potential is created that accelerates the ions before impacting the walls. Knowing the ion distribution is extremely important in plasma modeling and in plasma material interactions. As the complete physical simulations take a considerable amount of computational cost and time, neural networks and deep learning provide the ability to produce the results at a much faster and at smaller computational cost. We were ultimatly able to predict ion energy-angle impact distribution functions for a range of physical parameters by training on hPIC (hybrid particle in cell) simulation data with PyTorch.
